/**
 * Builds the household a read-only demonstration shows.
 *
 * Written through the ordinary services rather than as SQL, which is what
 * makes the demo an honest one: the subscriptions it shows went through the
 * same validation, the same price-history write and the same scoping as
 * anybody else's, so the figures on the dashboard are computed the way they
 * would be for a real household rather than typed in to look right.
 *
 * The accounts it creates are ordinary members of their own household, and
 * that is the whole of the isolation story. Neither is an instance
 * administrator, neither belongs to another household, and the scoping layer
 * answers "what may this account see" for them exactly as for anybody — so a
 * demo instance that also hosts real accounts shows the demo visitor the demo
 * data and nothing else.
 *
 * **There are two of them because a household of one demonstrates half the
 * application.** Roles, the per-member breakdown and the rule that a budget
 * measures one member's share all need somebody to compare against, and the
 * second account is a **Contributor** — the role whose whole definition is
 * that it reads the household and writes only its own part of it. Its rows are
 * written through *its own* scope rather than handed to it by the owner, so
 * what the demo shows is a household a Contributor really could have built.

     * Invented names, on purpose. A demonstration that lists real services

     * **The set is chosen to make the charts say something.** Both twelve-month
     * charts — the year behind and the year ahead — are drawn from individual
     * charges falling in the month they actually fall, so a household of
     * fourteen identical monthly subscriptions that all began on the same day
     * would draw two flat lines and demonstrate nothing. What makes a shape:
     *
     * - **Yearly and quarterly bills**, anchored to renew in *different*
     *   months, so the line has peaks where they land rather than a level
     *   average of them.
     * - **Staggered start dates**, some years back and some a few months, so
     *   the earlier half of the history has fewer subscriptions in it than the
     *   later half and the line climbs the way a real one does.
     * - **Price rises with the dates they took effect**, which is the only
     *   thing that makes the reconstruction of the past a step rather than
     *   today's price stretched backwards.
     * - **An announced rise** that has not happened yet, which steps the
     *   forecast and not the history.
     * - **A cancelled subscription**, which is in the months it ran and absent
     *   from every month ahead.
     * - **Two trials**, so the forecast's second line has something to
     *   separate from the first and the band between them is visible.
     *
     * Everything is in GBP deliberately. A second currency would be more
     * realistic and would also mean that an instance with no exchange rate
     * cached yet draws no charts at all — the demo would then be demonstrating
     * the refusal rather than the feature.
     *
     * This is the owner's table. The second member's is `contributorFixtures()`
     * below, and the two are read together: the charts are drawn from the
     * household, so what the second table has to avoid is renewing in the
     * months this one already peaks in.
     *
     * `due` is relative to today; `start`, `rises` and `scheduled` are relative
