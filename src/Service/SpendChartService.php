/**
 * Spend month by month, as the bars a chart is drawn from.
 *
 * The dashboard's and the analytics screen's, which is the reason it is a
 * class rather than a private method. The two screens must agree about what
 * March costs, and the way to make that a fact about the code instead of a
 * claim in a comment is for there to be one piece of code that decides it: the
 * dashboard's six-and-six chart is `window()` asked for six months either side,
 * and the analytics screen's is the same call asked for twelve.
 *
 * Both halves are read from the services that own them. The months behind are
 * `SpendHistoryService`'s reconstruction ending yesterday, the months ahead are
 * `ForecastService`'s from today, and this month is the one bar that holds
 * both — already charged beneath, still due above. Nothing here walks a
 * subscription itself.
 *
 * Everything the browser draws is a height worked out on integer minor units
 * by `CssPercent`, and every string it prints was formatted here by ICU. The
 * axis is pinned to ticks named here for the same reason: an axis label is a
 * money value, and money values are formatted in one place.
 *
 * **When a month cannot be combined, there is no chart.** A bar for a month
 * whose total is missing would read as a cheap month rather than an unknown
 * one — the one failure mode worth refusing outright. The payload names the
 * currencies with no rate, and the card says so instead of drawing.
