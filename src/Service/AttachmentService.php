/**
 * Invoices and receipts attached to a subscription.
 *
 * The rule worth stating: an attachment inherits the *subscription's* owner,
 * and uploading requires being able to **write** that subscription rather than
 * merely to read it.
 *
 * The second half is what makes the first half true. Read access is wider than
 * write access by exactly one case — a member listed on a shared-cost split can
 * see a subscription they do not own — and in ISOLATED mode the scoping layer
 * forces a new row's owner to the user creating it. So had a read been enough,
 * a split participant could file a receipt against somebody else's bill and the
 * attachment would be stamped with *their* id, leaving it invisible to the
 * person whose bill it documents. Requiring write access removes the case
 * entirely: in ISOLATED mode only the owner can upload, so the owner the
 * scoping layer forces and the owner this service intends are the same person.
 *
 * `uploaded_by_user_id` keeps the other half of the fact, so who added it is
 * still answerable without it affecting who may read it.
