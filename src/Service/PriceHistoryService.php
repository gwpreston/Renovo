/**
 * What a subscription has cost, does cost, and is about to cost.
 *
 * The model is one immutable row per price, each with the date it takes
 * effect. Nothing overwrites anything:
 *
 *  - the **current** price is the latest row whose date has arrived;
 *  - a **scheduled** change is a row whose date has not;
 *  - the **history** is all of them, which is what the trend view draws.
 *
 * `subscriptions.price_minor` is a denormalisation of the first of those. Every
 * write that changes which row is current updates it in the same transaction,
 * which is the invariant that keeps the list view and the trend view telling
 * the same story. `applyDueChanges()` is the repair for the one case the write
 * path cannot cover — a scheduled row becoming current merely because time
 * passed, with nobody editing anything.
