/**
 * Putting somebody into a household, and everything that follows.
 *
 * **This is not registration, and the difference is the whole class.**
 * `AuthService::register()` creates a user *and a household* and makes them its
 * Owner — correct for open sign-up, and exactly wrong here. Adding a member
 * creates a user and a membership into the household the administrator already
 * has. A provisioning path that reused `register()` would give one family two
 * households and nobody would notice until the second person wondered where
 * everything had gone. The two paths therefore share only the small pieces —
 * hash a password, issue a token, send a mail — and never the sequence.
 *
 * Every method takes the acting user's Scope and asks it for the household. A
 * member id that arrives on a request is never trusted to say which household
 * it belongs to: it is looked up *within* the scope's household, and a member
 * of another one comes back as absent.
