/**
 * Currency conversion, and the honesty about when it is not available.
 *
 * Three things are worth understanding before changing anything here.
 *
 * **Every rate is stored against the instance's base currency.** A conversion
 * between two other currencies is a cross-rate through the base:
 * X -> Y is (base -> Y) divided by (base -> X). One row per currency rather
 * than one per pair, and a single refresh keeps all of them current.
 *
 * **A missing rate is a first-class answer.** `convert()` returns null rather
 * than throwing or substituting 1:1, and callers surface per-currency
 * subtotals instead of a combined figure. A total that silently treats a
 * hundred yen as a hundred pounds is worse than no total at all, so the
 * degraded path is the one the UI is built around and the one that is tested.
 *
 * **Refreshing never blocks a page.** The lazy refresh is best-effort: it is
 * attempted at most once per retry window, any failure is logged and swallowed,
 * and the previous cached table keeps being used. Operators who want rates kept
 * current without depending on someone loading a page run `rates:refresh` from
 * the scheduler.
