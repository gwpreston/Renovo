/**
 * The Forecast page: the next twelve months' KPIs, the months as bars split
 * into regular charges and lump renewals, what cancelling each subscription
 * would save, the trials about to start costing money, and the price changes
 * already announced. A month's charges one by one are the calendar's.
 *
 * **One walk.** Everything here is read from a single call to
 * `ForecastService::charges()`, bucketed into months by the forecast's own
 * `monthsOf()`. The chart, the KPIs and the cards cannot disagree about a
 * figure because they are sums over the same list — and the months are the
 * same months the dashboard's hatched bars draw, since those come from
 * `monthly()`, which is that same bucketing.
 *
 * Because every figure is a sum of forecast charges, each carries the
 * forecast's invariant with it: a scheduled price rise counts from its date,
 * a trial counts from its conversion, and "just mine" is the member's share of
 * each charge rather than a share of a total.
