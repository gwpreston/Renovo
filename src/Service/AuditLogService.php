/**
 * Writing and reading the audit trail.
 *
 * Every call site is a service, never a controller: what happened is a property
 * of the operation, not of the transport that asked for it, and the API phase
 * has to produce the same entries as the web UI without a second set of call
 * sites to remember.
 *
 * Recording is deliberately non-fatal. If the log write fails — the table is
 * full, the column is short, the connection dropped — the user's sign-in or
 * password change still completes and the failure goes to the application log.
 * The alternative is an audit trail that can take the whole application down,
 * which is a worse property than an audit trail with a gap in it that the
 * application log explains.
