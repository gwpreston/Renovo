 * Frankfurter — the default.

 * base, and publishes the European Central Bank's daily reference rates. That
 * combination is why it is the default: a new instance converts currencies
 * correctly without the operator signing up for anything.
 *
 * The ECB set covers the major currencies and no more. A currency outside it
 * simply has no rate, and the application shows that currency as its own
 * subtotal rather than guessing.
