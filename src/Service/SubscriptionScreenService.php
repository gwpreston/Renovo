/**
 * Everything on the my-subscriptions screen that the list's own query does not
 * already answer.
 *
 * The counterpart to DashboardService, and built on the same principle: not one
 * figure here is computed for this screen. The strip's counts are the statuses
 * the list filters by and its monthly figure is the statistics service's own;
 * the cancel-by card is `CancellationService`'s deadlines; the table's
 * conversions are the exchange-rate service's; the summary line's total is the
 * same per-currency rule applied to the rows the filter matched. Two screens
 * showing different answers to "what does this cost" is the failure this
 * arrangement forbids.
 *
 * **One near window.** Fourteen days, referenced from CancellationService
 * rather than re-declared, which is what makes "the same window the dashboard
 * uses" a fact about the code instead of a claim in a comment. It decides the
 * "Renewing soon" badge, the "in N days" hint and which cancel-by dates the
 * table mentions.
