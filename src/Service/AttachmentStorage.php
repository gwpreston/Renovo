/**
 * Where invoices and receipts live on disk.
 *
 * Deliberately not under `public/`, unlike logos. A logo is a public-ish image
 * whose URL leaks nothing; an invoice has an address and a card number on it.
 * Nothing here is reachable by the web server, so the only way to read a stored
 * file is the scoped streaming route, which asks the same questions about the
 * subscription that every other read does.
 *
 * Three rules make an upload safe, and all three are enforced here rather than
 * asked of callers:
 *
 *  - The type comes from the bytes. `finfo` reads the file's magic number; what
 *    the client called it and what it claimed the MIME type was are both
 *    ignored. A .pdf full of PHP is rejected because it is not a PDF.
 *  - The name is chosen by this application. Random hex plus an extension
 *    derived from the detected type, so an upload cannot pick its own path,
 *    escape the directory or arrive with a name the web server would execute.
 *  - The household is part of the path, which keeps one household's files from
 *    sharing a directory with another's even at rest.
