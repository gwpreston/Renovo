/**
 * The Overview dashboard: what the month and the year cost, what is coming,
 * and where the money goes.
 *
 * Nothing here computes a figure of its own. Every number is one an existing
 * service already produces — the statistics, the reconstruction, the forecast,
 * the budgets, the category breakdown, the price-rise rule — and this
 * assembles them into the shapes the cards render. That is the point: the
 * chart's future half *is* the Forecast page's months, its past half *is* the
 * reconstruction year-over-year totals, and a figure fixed in one place is
 * fixed on every screen that shows it.
 *
 * **Two windows, both from the forecast.** Due next 7 days and Coming up (30
 * days) are cut from the same walk of the forecast, so a trial converting on
 * Friday is in both, priced at what it will convert to.
 *
 * The Household view is `HouseholdDashboardService`'s.
