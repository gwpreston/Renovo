 * One screen for every member of the household, and what differs between
 * readers is decided here rather than in the template: whether this reader
 * may manage anybody, whose figures they may see (`HouseholdOverviewService`),
 * what each role may do (`RoleMatrix`), and how long an invitation lasts
 * (`HouseholdMemberService`). The template asks none of those questions again.
 *
 * Whether a control is *drawn* is all this decides. What refuses a forged
 * request is the route's permission and, behind it, the service's own check.
