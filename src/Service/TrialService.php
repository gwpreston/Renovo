/**
 * Free trials, and the moment they stop being free.
 *
 * The timing rule, stated once here because everything else follows from it:
 * **the trial's last day is the day the conversion charge falls.** A trial
 * ending on the 30th is free up to and including the 30th, and the first
 * payment is dated the 30th. Treating the end date as exclusive would put the
 * charge a day late and tell the user they had one more free day than they do,
 * which is the wrong direction to be wrong in.
 *
 * Conversion keeps the same subscription. The row does not end and get replaced
 * — it changes price, and that change is recorded in the price history like any
 * other, so the trend shows the step from nothing to something and says what
 * caused it.
