/**
 * Spend over the last twelve months as lines: one per category, or one per
 * member.
 *
 * The Household dashboard's "Spend over time" card, beside By category. Both
 * views are read off `SpendHistoryService`'s reconstruction — the one place
 * the past is rebuilt — so a line's March is the March every other screen
 * shows. By category is one walk grouped; by member is one walk per member,
 * each counting only that member's share, by the rule a member budget uses.
 *
 * **Twelve complete months.** The month in progress is left off: drawn to
 * date it would be a line falling off a cliff at the right edge, reading as a
 * collapse in spending rather than a month not yet over. "This month so far"
 * is the card that shows it.
 *
 * **Who gets a line per member is `HouseholdOverviewService::whoPays()`'s
 * answer**, not a second decision made here: its rows are already filtered
 * for isolation, withheld figures and a Viewer's reach. The member view is
 * offered only when those rows are a comparison — more than one of them.
 *
 * **When a month cannot be combined, there is no chart.** Exactly as the pace
 * card and the spend bars refuse: a line through a month whose total is
 * missing would dip where the unconvertible currency was. The currencies with
 * no rate are named instead.
 *
 * Every point is an integer worked out on minor units, in a fixed SVG box the
 * template stretches, and the axis labels come from `SpendChartService` so
 * money is formatted in the one place it always is.
