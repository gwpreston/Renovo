/**
 * Budgets and how close they are to being blown.
 *
 * **The trigger is projected spend, not spend so far.** A budget that only
 * reacts once the money has gone is a report, not a budget. What matters is
 * that a scheduled price rise or a trial about to convert will push the member
 * over, and that they hear about it while there is still something they can do.
 *
 * **The projection comes from the forecast, deliberately, rather than from a
 * monthly run-rate.** The two would otherwise disagree: a budget computed from
 * today's prices would miss the very increases that this phase exists to track,
 * and the dashboard would show a budget comfortably under its limit directly
 * above a forecast saying otherwise. Sharing one implementation makes that
 * impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * A budget measures its **subject**: one member's share — their own
 * subscriptions in full, their portion of anything split, nothing belonging to
 * anybody else — or, with no subject, the whole household. The owner is only
 * whoever set it. Either way the figure is computed in the scope of whoever is
 * looking, so another member's "only me" subscription is never in it, and a
 * figure that scope cannot honestly compute is reported as unavailable rather
 * than as a partial total that looks like a whole one.
 *
 * Firing alerts is Phase 3. This phase computes the state and shows it.
