/**
 * Dividing a subscription's cost between household members.
 *
 * Two rules carry the whole feature.
 *
 * **Shares are derived, never stored.** The database holds integer weights; the
 * money is computed from the current price every time it is asked for. A stored
 * amount would be right on the day it was entered and wrong from the next price
 * change onwards, and nobody would notice until the shares stopped adding up.
 *
 * **The parts always sum to the whole.** Allocation hands out the leftover
 * minor units rather than rounding each share independently, so £10 split three
 * ways is 3.34 / 3.33 / 3.33 and not three times 3.33 with a penny unaccounted
 * for.
 *
 * Visibility is not this class's business. A participant's right to *see* a
 * subscription they contribute to is applied by the scoping layer's read
 * predicate, structurally, for every query at once — not by anything here
 * remembering to ask.
