/**
 * The analytics screen: the year-to-date KPI row, twelve months back and twelve
 * ahead, this year against last, who pays what, the most expensive
 * subscriptions, the household's price history and the insights — then the
 * breakdown donuts and the review figures the page has always carried.
 *
 * The third of these assemblers, after DashboardService and
 * SubscriptionScreenService, and held to the same rule: **not one figure here
 * is computed for this screen.** Spend already paid is
 * `SpendHistoryService`'s reconstruction, spend still to come is
 * `ForecastService`'s, the chart is the dashboard's own chart asked for twelve
 * months a side, who pays is the household dashboard's card, the price history
 * is `PriceHistoryService`'s, and the insights are `SpendInsightService`'s.
 * This class decides what goes where, and what "most expensive" ranks on —
 * see `mostExpensive()`.
 *
 * **Known cost: several walks of the household for one page.** The statistics
 * read every subscription; the chart, this year against last and the two
 * year-to-date sums each reconstruct the past with their own window; the
 * forecast is walked for the chart, the year and the next twelve months. Each
 * reconstruction reads price history once per subscription. Sharing one walk
 * would mean changing what those services hand back rather than what they
 * compute, which is a change to services three screens depend on. Worth
 * fixing when something else touches it; stated here so it is a known cost
 * rather than a surprise.

     * normalisation the whole application compares costs with.
     *
     * **It ranks on the base currency and excludes what cannot reach it.** Two
     * amounts in currencies with no rate between them have no order, and
     * inventing one by comparing the digits would rank 900 JPY above 50 GBP.
     * A subscription whose currency has no rate is therefore left out and
     * counted, and the count is shown.
     *
     * **It is running recurring subscriptions only.** `monthlyMinor()` is null
     * for a one-off or a lifetime purchase, which has no monthly cost to rank.
     * A running trial costs nothing until it converts, and pricing it at its
     * converted price would make it one figure here and another in the KPI
     * row. Paused and cancelled rows are not costing anything either — a
     * cancelled row can still be flagged active, so it is asked for by name.
     *
     * Each result is displayed in **its own currency** — the conversion decides
