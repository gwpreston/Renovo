/**
 * The state between "the password was right" and "you are signed in".
 *
 * This is the most security-sensitive small class in the phase, so the rules it
 * enforces are worth naming:
 *
 *  - A user waiting on a second factor is NOT signed in. The pending state is
 *    kept under its own session key; `AuthenticationMiddleware` keys off
 *    `user_id` and never sees it, so every authenticated route treats that
 *    browser as anonymous. Reusing the real key with a "verified" flag beside it
 *    would mean any route that forgot to check the flag was an authentication
 *    bypass.
 *  - The pending state expires. A challenge left open in a browser tab
 *    overnight is not a valid claim about who is there in the morning.
 *  - Clearing it is the caller's responsibility at exactly two moments: when the
 *    factor is accepted, and when the user gives up. Both are explicit calls,
 *    because a pending state that lingers is a second chance somebody else could
 *    use.
