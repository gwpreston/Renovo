/**
 * The one place a browser becomes signed in.
 *
 * Three routes end here — password with no second factor, password followed by
 * a second factor, and a usernameless passkey — and every one of them needs the
 * same four things done in the same order. A second implementation of that
 * sequence is how one of them ends up missing the session regeneration, so
 * there is only ever one.
 *
 * The order matters:
 *  1. Regenerate the session id, so a fixed id planted before sign-in is not
 *     the id that ends up authenticated.
 *  2. Rotate the CSRF token, so a token captured before the privilege change
 *     cannot be replayed after it.
 *  3. Only then write the user id, which is what every authenticated route
 *     keys off.
 *  4. Record it, with the method used, because "signed in with a passkey" and
 *     "signed in with a password and a code" are different facts to anyone
 *     reading the log afterwards.
 *
 * Being the one place also makes it the one place a revoked login can be
 * stopped for good. Checking `disabled_at` in the password path alone would
 * leave the passkey and second-factor routes open, so the check is here as
 * well — see `establish()`.
