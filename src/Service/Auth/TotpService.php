/**
 * Enrolling in, verifying and removing an authenticator-app second factor.
 *
 * Enrolment is two steps on purpose. `beginEnrolment()` stores an unconfirmed
 * secret and hands back the provisioning URI; the factor only becomes real when
 * `confirmEnrolment()` sees a code generated from it. A user who scans a QR
 * code into an app that then fails to save it, or who closes the page half-way,
 * is left exactly where they started rather than locked out of their own
 * account by a secret nobody holds.
 *
 * Removing the factor requires the current password. Otherwise a stolen but
 * still-signed-in session could quietly strip the protection that is there to
 * limit what a stolen session is worth.
