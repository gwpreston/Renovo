/**
 * What the next twelve months will actually cost.
 *
 * The forecast walks each subscription's billing dates forward one at a time
 * and records the charge that falls on each. It is not a monthly run-rate
 * multiplied by twelve, and the difference is the whole point: a yearly
 * subscription renewing in March is a bill in March, not a twelfth of itself
 * every month, and knowing which month it lands in is what makes the number
 * useful.
 *
 * **The invariant that everything else depends on.** The price used for a
 * charge is the price that will be in force on the date of that charge — the
 * scheduled price change that has been announced, the trial conversion that
 * has been recorded — never the subscription's current price extended across
 * the horizon.
 *
 * That is what keeps the forecast stable over time. As each of those dates
 * arrives, the catch-up applies the same change to the database that the
 * forecast has been predicting all along, so the figure for a given month does
 * not move. A forecast that read only `subscriptions.price_minor` would quietly
 * ignore every scheduled change and then jump on the day it took effect, and
 * budgets built on it would appear to drift for no reason anybody could see.
