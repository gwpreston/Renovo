/**
 * The Budgets screen: its status tiles, one card per budget, and the
 * household's last six months against its monthly limit.
 *
 * Nothing here is computed afresh. Each card is `BudgetMonthService`'s read of
 * the budget over its calendar period — so a monthly budget shows the figures
 * the dashboard does — and the history is `SpendChartService::window()`, the
 * dashboard chart's own months. What this adds is the reading: which state a
 * budget is in, which note says so, and how wide each part of its bar is.
 *
 * **Over is the projection including trials.** A budget under its limit on
 * what is committed but over it once the running trials convert is Over, with
 * a note that says it is the trials — the one case a member can still undo by
 * cancelling.
 *
 * **A budget with no honest figure is in no state.** One whose spend includes
 * a currency with no rate, or one this scope cannot measure whole, counts in
 * no tile and is never shown as on track, as the alert state machine refuses
 * to call it under.
 *
