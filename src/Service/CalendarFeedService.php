 * Read-only by construction — it emits text and touches nothing — and that is
 * what makes it safe to hand to a calendar client that will fetch it
 * unattended for years.
 *
 * Three kinds of event, because three different things are worth a reminder in
 * a diary: the next payments, the day a trial turns into a bill, and the last
 * day to cancel before a notice period makes that impossible. The third is the
 * one a calendar is genuinely better at than a notification — it is a deadline,
 * not an event, and seeing it a fortnight out is the entire point.
 *
 * Every event is a whole-day event with no time zone. A billing date is a date,
 * not an instant; giving it a time would move it across midnight for somebody.
