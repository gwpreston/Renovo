/**
 * The first-run wizard's second and third steps: the household, and reminders.
 *
 * Step one — the owner account — is SetupService, and it is the only step that
 * runs before anybody is signed in. Everything here runs afterwards, as the new
 * instance administrator, and every setting it touches is one Settings or
 * Notifications already changes: the household's name, the base currency, the
 * isolation mode, the rate provider, lead times, budget alerts, channels. So
 * nothing here decides anything new — each value goes through the service that
 * owns it, and a step left on its defaults changes nothing at all.
 *
 * The one thing the steps hold between requests is the invitation list. It is
 * checked on the household step, where a bad address can be corrected, and
 * sent when setup finishes — so an owner who goes back and changes their mind
 * has invited nobody yet.
