 * Where a member's picture lives, and what it has been turned into first.
 *
 * Not under `public/`, unlike a subscription's logo, and the difference is not
 * fussiness. A logo is a company's mark and its URL discloses nothing; an
 * avatar on a family instance is a photograph of a child. It is served by a
 * route that asks who is looking — see the streaming route — and the bytes
 * never sit anywhere the web server can reach on its own.
 *
 * **Nothing that arrives is stored.** The upload is decoded by GD and a new
 * image is drawn from the pixels, which is the strongest of the three defences
 * here and the reason the phase takes a dependency on `ext-gd`:
 *
 *  - The type comes from the bytes, via `getimagesize()`, never from the name
 *    or the declared MIME type.
 *  - Re-encoding discards everything that is not a pixel. EXIF — which on a
 *    phone photograph includes where it was taken — is gone, as is any payload
 *    hidden in a comment field, and a polyglot file that is both a valid PNG
 *    and a valid script stops being the second one.
 *  - The result is square, capped, and always PNG, so a 4000-pixel portrait
 *    does not become a 4000-pixel avatar and the extension is not a variable.
