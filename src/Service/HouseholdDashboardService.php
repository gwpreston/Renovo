/**
 * The Household dashboard: how this month is going, who pays what, and the
 * year against its budget pace.
 *
 * Like the Overview, it computes nothing of its own. The month so far is the
 * reconstruction up to yesterday beside the forecast from today — the same
 * split the Overview chart draws for this month, from the same two services,
 * so the two views cannot disagree about it. Year to date is the
 * reconstruction; the next twelve months is the forecast; who pays is the
 * household screen's own figures.
 *
 * **"Already charged", never "paid".** Nothing in Renovo confirms that a
 * payment went through; the month so far is the charges whose dates have
 * passed. The wording on the card says exactly that.
 *
 * **The budget is the household's.** The marker on the month and the pace
 * line are the household's overall budget, because the figures they sit
 * against are household-wide; a member's own budget would make them wrong
 * percentages. With no such budget — and in ISOLATED mode there is never one —
 * there is no marker and no pace card: an invented limit is worse than none.
