/**
 * The single road from "something happened" to "somebody was told".
 *
 * Every alert type goes through this one method, and so does the wizard's test
 * message. That is deliberate: four alert types with four delivery paths would
 * be four places to get idempotency wrong, and the one that was got wrong would
 * be the one nobody noticed until it had sent a user the same reminder eleven
 * times.
 *
 * The order of operations is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. **Claim, then send.** The ledger row is written first. If the process
 *      dies between the claim and the send, the next run sees a stale `pending`
 *      row and retries it — one duplicate at worst. Sending first and recording
 *      afterwards would lose the record of a message that *was* delivered, and
 *      re-send it every day thereafter.
 *   2. **A failure is per channel.** One dead webhook must not stop the other
 *      channels, the other alerts, the other users, or the rest of the run. The
 *      failure is recorded against both the ledger row and the channel, so the
 *      user can see why their phone went quiet.
 *   3. **Nothing thrown escapes.** A notifier that raises something other than
 *      NotifierException — a malformed URL deep in a library, say — is still a
 *      broken channel, not a broken scheduler.
