/**
 * The scheduler's day's work.
 *
 * One pass over every user, and for each user over **every household they
 * belong to**. That second loop is easy to leave out and the bug it causes is
 * invisible: `ScopeFactory` defaults to a user's first membership, so a member
 * of two households would quietly get reminders for one of them and silence for
 * the other, with nothing in any log to say so.
 *
 * Within a household the order matters and is the same order the page-load
 * catch-up uses, for the same reason: due price changes are applied and ended
 * trials converted *before* anything is read, so a reminder quotes the price
 * that will actually be charged rather than the one that was superseded this
 * morning. Getting this backwards produces alerts that are plausible, specific
 * and wrong.
 *
 * Failure is contained per user. A broken channel, an unreachable host, a
 * corrupt row — none of them may stop the other users being told about their
 * money.
