/**
 * The month view of what is coming: charges, the day a free trial starts
 * charging, and the last day to cancel before a notice period bites, laid out
 * on a grid with one day open beside it.
 *
 * It asks ForecastService for the charges rather than walking billing dates
 * again. That is the same rule the forecast page and the budgets follow, and
 * it is what makes the calendar agree with them: a scheduled price rise shows
 * the price that will actually be taken, and a trial conversion appears on the
 * day the trial ends, because the one piece of code that knows those rules is
 * the one being asked.
 *
 * The horizon is the forecast's horizon, and it starts this month. A calendar
 * that could be paged back into last year would be promising a history this
 * application does not keep — it tracks what is due, not a ledger of what was
 * paid — so a month outside it is refused rather than drawn empty.
 *
 * Deadlines come from CancellationService, the cancel-by screen's own reading,
 * and are kept only for subscriptions already among the forecast's charges.
 * That is what holds them inside the same scoped, split-filtered set as
 * everything else on the page — "just mine" included — rather than letting a
 * second list bring its own ideas about who may see what. A deadline is not a
 * charge: it is drawn, and never counted in a total.
 *
 * Every figure beside the grid is a selection over those same items, made here
 * rather than in the template.
