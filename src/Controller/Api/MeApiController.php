 * Who this token is, and what it can do.

 * The first call a client makes, and the one that saves it guessing. It reports
 * the effective answer — role, isolation mode and the resolved permission list
 * — rather than leaving a script to infer from a 403 that it should not have
 * tried. The permissions are computed by the same PermissionService the routes
 * assert with, so what this says and what the API allows cannot disagree.
