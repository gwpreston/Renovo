/**
 * The account's own page: who one person is, how they get in, and how Renovo
 * looks and behaves for them.
 *
 * Separate from Settings because the two answer different questions. Nothing
 * here needs a permission — every value changes what one account sees and
 * nothing that anybody else does — whereas most of Settings is a household or
 * an instance deciding something on everybody's behalf.
 *
 * `/profile`, `/profile/account` and `/settings/security` used to be three
 * screens, and the lines between them were not ones a reader had to draw:
 * each acted on the id in the session and none needed a permission. They are
 * one page now. This controller renders it; `AccountController` answers the
 * name, address, password and picture forms on it and `SecurityController`
 * the second factors and sessions — one page, three controllers, because
 * "how this looks", "who is looking" and "how they get in" remain different
 * subjects however they are laid out.
