/**
 * What happens to one member's household rows, and their membership, when they
 * are removed.
 *
 * A repository of its own because the operation crosses every table that
 * carries an `owner_user_id`, and doing it one scoped call at a time is
 * impossible by construction: in ISOLATED mode the Owner running the removal
 * cannot see the departing member's rows, so a scoped UPDATE would match
 * nothing and the rows would be left pointing at somebody who is no longer
 * here.
 *
 * That is why every method takes a Scope and refuses one that is not an
 * Owner/Admin of the household it names — the same shape as
 * `AuditLogRepository`'s administrator reads. The scope is still the
 * authority; what changes is the question asked of it. "May this person
 * administer this household?" is not the same question as "may they read this
 * row?", and removal is the first operation that needs the former.
 *
 * The tables are listed once, here. A later phase that adds another table with
 * an `owner_user_id` has exactly one place to add it, and the absence of the
 * row it forgot would otherwise show up as a foreign key pointing at a
 * stranger.
 *
 * The whole removal is one transaction, including the membership row, which is
 * why that row is deleted here rather than through `MembershipRepository`. A
 * removal that got halfway is the worst of the possible outcomes: a member
 * whose subscriptions have moved but who is still in the household, or one who
 * has left and whose split shares went with them while their subscriptions did
 * not. Files are the one thing outside it, because deleting a file cannot be
 * rolled back — so the paths are collected inside and handed to the caller to
 * unlink once the rows are actually gone.
