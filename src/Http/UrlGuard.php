/**
 * Decides whether a user-supplied URL may be fetched, and to which address.
 *
 * The threat this exists for: a user who can make the server issue a request
 * can reach everything the server can reach, which on a self-hosted box is the
 * whole home network and, in a cloud, the metadata service holding the
 * instance's credentials. A webhook URL, a Gotify server, a chat endpoint —
 * every one of them is an address typed by somebody, and every one of them
 * comes through here first.
 *
 * The sequence matters:
 *
 *   1. **Parse strictly.** No credentials in the URL (they would be carried
 *      into a redirect and logged by whatever is at the other end), a host that
 *      is actually present, a scheme of http or https.
 *   2. **Resolve the name, then judge the address.** Judging the name is
 *      worthless: "evil.example" is a perfectly ordinary name that resolves to
 *      127.0.0.1 if its owner wants it to.
 *   3. **Refuse the host if _any_ of its addresses is private.** Not "pick a
 *      public one": a name with both an A record on the internet and one on
 *      169.254.169.254 is an attack, not a dual-stack deployment.
 *   4. **Apply the allowlist, and log when it is what let a request through.**
 *      A private address is reachable only because an administrator said so,
 *      and the log is where that shows up afterwards.
 *   5. **Hand back the address that was checked**, so the connection uses it
 *      rather than resolving the name a second time. Between step 2 and the
 *      connection there is otherwise a window in which the answer can change —
 *      DNS rebinding is exactly that window, deliberately widened.
 *
 * Scheme policy is "https, or http to a trusted host". A self-hosted Gotify on
 * a LAN is routinely plain http, and an operator who has already made the
 * deliberate, logged decision to trust that host is not helped by a second
 * refusal on the scheme. Everything else must be https.
