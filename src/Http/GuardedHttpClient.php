/**
 * The client for URLs a user typed.
 *
 * Everything in the application that fetches a destination somebody entered —
 * a Gotify server, a webhook, a chat endpoint — goes through this rather than
 * through the plain client. It adds the two things a user-supplied URL needs
 * and a configured one does not:
 *
 *  - **Vetting, then pinning.** The guard resolves the host and judges the
 *    address; the address it judged is the address curl dials. A name that
 *    answers "93.184.216.34" to our lookup and "127.0.0.1" to curl's is the
 *    whole of DNS rebinding, and pinning is what removes the second lookup.
 *  - **Following redirects by hand.** curl would follow them itself, which
 *    means connecting to the new location before anything has judged it. Here
 *    each hop is refused or vetted first, and only then followed — with the
 *    same pinning applied again, because a redirect to the same host is still
 *    a fresh resolution.
 *
 * Note what happens to the body on a method-changing redirect: it is dropped.
 * A 303 turning a POST into a GET must not carry the POST's payload — that is
 * how a notification body ends up in a query-less GET to somewhere it was not
 * meant for.
