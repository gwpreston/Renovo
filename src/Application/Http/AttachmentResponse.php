/**
 * Streams a stored attachment back to an authorised caller.
 *
 * Shared by the web route and the API route so the headers cannot diverge, and
 * every one of them is load-bearing:
 *
 *  - The Content-Type is the type this application *detected* when the file was
 *    stored, never what the uploader claimed. Combined with `nosniff`, that is
 *    what stops a file that talked its way past validation from being executed
 *    or rendered as HTML in the instance's own origin.
 *  - `Content-Disposition: attachment` means even an image is downloaded rather
 *    than rendered in the page.
 *  - The filename is sent twice: a stripped ASCII form for old clients and an
 *    RFC 5987 `filename*` for everything else, because an invoice called
 *    "facture-août.pdf" should arrive with its name intact.
 *  - `private, no-store` keeps a receipt out of shared caches.

     * The one deliberate difference from `stream()` is the disposition: an
     * avatar is the target of an `<img src>`, so `attachment` would make every
     * face on the page a download prompt. Everything that made that safe stays
     * — `nosniff`, and a type this application chose rather than one a client
     * claimed — and here the type is not merely detected but guaranteed:
     * `AvatarStorage` re-encodes every upload to PNG, so the bytes on disk were
     * written by GD and by nothing else.
     *
     * `no-cache` rather than a max-age, because the URL is the member's id and
     * does not change when their picture does. A cached avatar would outlive
     * the one it replaced, and on the remove path would outlive it entirely.
