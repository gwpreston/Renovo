/**
 * One thing worth telling somebody, in a form every channel can render.
 *
 * An alert carries both what to say and who it is about, and the second part
 * is what the ledger keys on. `subjectType`, `subjectId` and `occurrenceKey`
 * together are the alert's identity: send the same identity twice and the
 * second send is suppressed, which is the whole of the idempotency guarantee.
 *
 * The body is a list of lines rather than a formatted string because the
 * channels disagree about formatting — email wants paragraphs, Gotify wants
 * plain text, Slack wants its own markup. Handing each of them the same
 * pre-formatted blob would mean the ugliest renderer decides how all of them
 * look.
