/**
 * One row of the members screen's "What each role can do" table.
 *
 * Deliberately not `Permission`. That enum is the vocabulary the routes assert
 * in, and it is the wrong size for a reader: nobody comparing roles wants
 * `attachment.manage` and `price.manage` as two rows when they are one idea.
 * So each row is a plain-language capability that *names* the permissions it
 * stands for, and `RoleMatrix` answers it by putting every one of them to
 * `PermissionService`. The grouping is a presentation decision; what is in
 * each group is not, and a row whose permissions disagree for some role is
 * refused rather than rounded to one answer.
 *
 * The fence is the other half. A permission says *whether* a role may do a
 * thing; the scoping layer says *whose* rows it may do it to. A row that
 * touches rows says which of the two scoping questions reaches it — reads or
 * writes — so "Own only" is the scoping layer's answer and not a word chosen
 * here.
