 * typo waiting to split one event into two.
 *
 * Cases arrive with the feature they describe, which is why the member
 * administration block below did not exist until Phase 15 built the screen it
 * records. Until then there was no `member.login_revoked`, because nothing
 * could revoke a login: the users table had no column for it and no UI reached
 * it, and a filter in the admin view that can never match anything implies an
 * audit guarantee nothing is enforcing. The rule still holds for whatever is
 * absent now.
