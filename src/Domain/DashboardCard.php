/**
 * The blocks the two dashboards are made of.
 *
 * Each case belongs to one view and is a template under
 * `templates/dashboard/cards/{view}/`, included by name. Adding a card is
 * adding a case and a file; the page walks whatever list it is handed and
 * knows nothing about what is in them.
 *
 * The order of a view's cases is its default layout. **Overview** reads like
 * the prototype's variant A: the four figures, then the months behind and
 * ahead beside where the money goes, then what is coming with the budgets, the
 * trials and the next price rise stacked beside it. **Household** is variant
 * B: how this month is going, the next thirty days, who carries what beside
 * where it goes, and the year against its budget.
 *
 * Phase 21 replaced the Phase 10 set wholesale, and a migration cleared every
 * saved layout once so nobody's arrangement points at cards that have gone.
 * The keys whose meaning survived kept their names — `totals` is still the
 * figures row, `by_category` still the category split, `recent` the
 * subscriptions table — and the rest are new.
 *
 * The case *values* are stored in `dashboard_cards.card_key`, so they are a
 * data format. Renaming one would orphan every row that holds it. Removing one
 * is survivable: the layout is read back as raw strings and merged against
 * these cases, so a row naming a key no case answers to is passed over.
