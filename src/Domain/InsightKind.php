 * What a spend insight noticed.

 * are deliberately small: an insight this application shows can be checked by
 * the member against their own rows, which rules out anything it cannot name
 * the arithmetic for.
 *
 * The order of the cases is the order they are shown in, and `rank()` is what
 * enforces it. It is urgency, not size: a trial converting on Friday can only
 * be acted on before Friday, a scheduled rise only before it lands, and an
 * overlap or a rarely-used subscription is as actionable next month as it is
 * today. Ranking on the figure instead would push a £4 trial below a £300
 * overlap and let it convert while the member read about the overlap.
