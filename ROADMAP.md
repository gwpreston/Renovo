# Roadmap

Where Renovo is, and what may come next. This is a list of **candidates, not
scope**: nothing here is built until a phase brief in
[`docs/phases/PHASE.md`](docs/phases/PHASE.md) names it (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## v1 — Phases 1–29

v1 is everything built in Phases 1 to 29: the foundation, money, notifications
and the scheduler, advanced auth, the API and import/backup, i18n and demo mode
(1–6); the build pipeline, design system and first pass over every screen
(7–14); household membership, more notification channels and payment methods
(15–17); the Renovo re-skin (18–28); and the signed-out screens (29). The
[README](README.md#renovo) summarises each phase, and every phase's brief,
decisions and deferrals are archived in [`docs/phases/`](docs/phases/).

v1.0.0 was released on 1 October 2026 ([CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)).

## After v1

Work after v1 continues as numbered phases, each with its own brief in
`docs/phases/PHASE.md`, and releases group finished phases (v1.1, v1.2, … and
v2 for anything that breaks an upgrade path).

Briefs for phases that have not started are drafted in
[`docs/phases/drafts/`](docs/phases/drafts/). A draft is still not scope: it
becomes scope when it is moved to `docs/phases/PHASE.md`, and its decisions are
confirmed or corrected before the build starts. When a phase finishes, its brief
is archived as `docs/phases/PHASE-<n>.md` as before.

## Planned — Phases 30–43

Numbered in the order they were drafted; the **Needs** column is the build
order. Each phase lists what it needs; where it needs nothing it says so, and
can be moved.

| Phase | Brief | Needs | Data model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30 | Shipped as the API catch-up; secrets encryption moved to 40 | — | — |
| 31 | [The scenario planner](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-31.md) | — | None |
| 32 | [Billing every N weeks, months or years](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-32.md) | — | 2 columns |
| 33 | [Introductory and promotional prices](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-33.md) | — | 1 column |
| 34 | [The payment ledger](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-34.md) | — | 1 table, 1 column |
| 35 | [Contracts, fixed terms and bills that vary](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-35.md) | 32, 34 | 5 migrations |
| 36 | [What you've saved](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-36.md) | 31, 33, 34, 35 | 1 column |
| 37 | [The version, and knowing when there is a newer one](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-37.md) | — | 1 column |
| 38 | [Instance backups: scheduled, encrypted, verified](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-38.md) | 40 | 1 table |
| 39 | [Backups off the server, and proof they restore](docs/phases/drafts/PHASE-39.md) | 40, 38 | 3 tables, alert preferences |
| 40 | [Secrets at rest, and rotating the key that guards them](docs/phases/PHASE-40.md) | — | 2–3 migrations (backfill) |
| 41 | [Security headers and a strict Content-Security-Policy](docs/phases/PHASE-41.md) | — | None |
| 42 | [API tokens: scopes, lifetimes and rate limits](docs/phases/PHASE-42.md) | 40 | 1 table, 1 column |
| 43 | [Control over outbound requests, and supply-chain checks](docs/phases/PHASE-43.md) | — | 1 column |

- **30 — Shipped as the API catch-up** for tags and payment-method logos
  ([brief](docs/phases/PHASE-30.md)). The channel-secret encryption that was
  planned here was never built; it is now Phase 40.
- **31 — The scenario planner.** Cancel or reprice several subscriptions at once
  and see the run-rate and twelve-month saving before changing anything, with
  each saving starting at the first charge a notice period still allows. Builds
  on the Forecast screen's **If you cancelled**, and corrects that card to stop
  counting charges a notice period has already committed.
- **32 — Billing every N weeks, months or years.** Six-monthly, two-monthly,
  two-yearly and fortnightly cycles without day-count drift, and a "last day of
  the month" option. Fixes the import reading "6 months" as every six days.
- **33 — Introductory and promotional prices.** A price can be marked as an
  offer with what it becomes; insights, alerts and the trend chart say "intro
  offer ends" rather than "price rise".
- **34 — The payment ledger.** One row per charge, written as each billing date
  passes; a member can record the actual amount, mark a charge as skipped and
  attach its invoice. The calendar pages backwards. *Not bank sync* — every row
  comes from Renovo's own billing rules or a member.
- **35 — Contracts, fixed terms and bills that vary.** A contract end date with
  an alert; finance with a last payment, after which the row ends itself; and
  bills whose price is an estimate corrected from recorded actuals. Behaviours
  rather than an expense-type label.
- **36 — What you've saved.** Saved through offers, and spend removed by
  cancellations, from the ledger, on Analytics and as an optional dashboard
  card.
- **37 — The version, and update checks.** A single `VERSION` file shown inside
  the application, and an opt-in daily check of the latest GitHub release with a
  dismissable dashboard banner for instance admins. Independent of 31–36: it can
  be built at any point, and is worth bringing forward if releases start before
  36 is done.
- **38 — Instance backups.** The disaster-recovery backup the household archive
  was never meant to be: every table and stored file, engine-portable, taken
  daily or weekly, always encrypted with an env-only key, verified after it is
  written, and pruned by a daily / weekly / monthly policy that never deletes the
  newest good copy. Restored by command into an empty database. Needs Phase 40
  so channel secrets are not in it in plain text.
- **39 — Off-server backups and restore rehearsal.** Each verified backup sent to
  S3-compatible storage (AWS, Backblaze B2, R2, MinIO), WebDAV or a mounted
  directory, with its own retention per destination; a scheduled rehearsal that
  downloads a remote copy and restores it into a scratch database; and the first
  alerts for instance admins (backup failed, stale, rehearsal failed).
- **40 — Secrets at rest and key rotation.** Channel config and the
  exchange-rate key encrypted through `SecretCipher`, which gains a key ring
  (`SECRETS_KEY`, `SECRETS_PREVIOUS_KEYS`) and a `secrets:rotate` command; a
  password change or reset revokes the user's API tokens; channel changes are
  audited. *Phase 16 — "Worth its own small phase".* **Build before 38.**
- **41 — Security headers and a strict CSP.** Headers set in the application
  rather than only by nginx; a nonce-based policy with no inline script, eval or
  inline style, which means moving the inline scripts, `onsubmit` confirms and
  `style=` attributes out of the templates, with a CI guard against their
  return. HSTS opt-in, for instances served over plain http on a LAN.
- **42 — API tokens: scopes, lifetimes, rate limits.** Per-resource scopes
  (existing read/write tokens mapped across), a 90-day default lifetime and an
  optional instance maximum, a 429 limit per token and per IP on `/api/v1` and
  the feed, and failed token authentication audited.
- **43 — Outbound control and supply chain.** `OUTBOUND_HTTP=open|allowlist|off`
  enforced inside the shared client; refused requests audited; a documented
  no-route-out Docker setup; `composer audit`, `npm audit`, an image scan and
  Dependabot in CI; `SECURITY.md`; SMTP certificates verified by default.

Phases 37–43 need nothing from 31–36, so they can be brought forward and
renumbered if operational work should come before features. Within them, 40
comes before 38 and 42; 41 and 43 can go anywhere.

Renovo has no AI integration. Any future one (a local model host, say) is a
user-supplied URL like a webhook: it goes through the guarded client and, if
private, the trusted-host list.

A suggested grouping, to adjust as phases finish: **v1.1** — 30, 37; **v1.2** —
31, 32, 33; **v1.3** — 34, 35, 36; **v1.4** — 38, 39. Phases 40–43 are not yet grouped;
40 ships with or before 38.

## Candidates

Deferred during v1 or by the planned briefs. Each names where it was deferred.
Unordered until someone picks them up.

### Sign-in and accounts

- **OIDC / SSO.** Left out of Phase 4 by decision; the largest missing piece
  for anyone running Renovo beside other self-hosted services. It would use the
  shared HTTP client for discovery and the trusted-host allowlist for private
  providers. *Phases 4, 6.*
- **Name the inviter on an invitation.** Nothing records who sent an invite,
  so the page says only "You have been invited to join {household}". A
  data-model change. *Phase 29.*

### Notifications

- **Browser push (Web Push).** It needs a per-device subscription table, a
  service worker, VAPID config, a transport redirected through the guarded
  client and a front-end permission flow. The caveats go with it: delivery goes
  through the browser vendor's push service, so it is the one channel that
  cannot work offline, and it needs a secure context. *Phases 16, 28.*
- **An Apprise bridge.** It would add every channel Apprise supports behind the
  existing `Notifier` interface, without writing another class per service.
  *Phases 6, 16.*
- **Per-type lead times.** One set of lead times covers every dated alert
  today. The chips' markup (`lead_types`) already names the types. *Phase 28.*
- **An update alert through channels.** Phase 37 shows a dashboard banner only;
  its scheduler step is the seam, and Phase 39's backup alerts are the pattern
  for an instance-admin `AlertType`. *Phases 37, 39.*

### Money and data

- **A `paused_at` date.** Pausing is a flag, so past spend can't tell when a
  pause began, and Phase 36 cannot count savings from a pause. *Phases 20, 36.*
- **Category groups.** Categories are flat by decision. *Phase 20.*
- **An expense kind field** (Subscription, Bill, Insurance, Finance …), only as
  a filter and a default for Phase 35's behaviours — not as a second set of
  categories. *Phase 35.*
- **Rounding** of displayed figures. *Phase 28.*
- **More exchange-rate providers.** *Phase 28.*

### Backups

- **More destinations**: SFTP, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, behind the
  `BackupDestination` interface. *Phase 39.*
- **Native dump formats** (`pg_dump`, `mysqldump`) as an alternative to the
  engine-portable rows, for very large instances. *Phase 38.*
- **The `age` format**, so a backup can be decrypted with a standard tool.
  *Phase 38.*
- **Key rotation** for existing instance backups. *Phase 38.*
- **Scheduled household archives** sent to a destination. *Phase 38.*
- **Multipart uploads** beyond 5 GB. *Phase 39.*

### Planning

- **Saved scenarios.** The planner's scenario lives in the query string, which
  is the seam for storing one by name. *Phase 31.*
- **Apply a scenario in one step** (bulk cancel and reprice). Each change goes
  through its own audited flow for now. *Phase 31.*
- **Budget impact in the planner** ("this keeps you under your household
  budget"). *Phase 31.*
- **Business-day adjustment** of billing dates. It moves a charge by a day or two
  and never changes a total, and would need bank-holiday data bundled per locale
  under the offline rule. *Phase 32.*
- **Nth-weekday cycles** ("the last Friday of the month"). *Phase 32.*

### Screens and copy

- **A dashboard insight tile.** The insights are on Analytics only, so the
  feature can be judged on one screen before it goes on two. *Phases 13, 23.*
- **"Recurring expenses" as the product's copy.** Worth doing once Phase 35's
  behaviours exist, as a separate change across the catalogue and README.
  *Phase 35.*

### Security

- **A CSP report endpoint.** An unauthenticated write path with its own rate
  limit and storage. *Phase 41.*
- **Signed outbound webhooks** (an HMAC header the receiver can check).
  *Phase 43.*
- **SBOM publication, image signing and CodeQL.** *Phase 43.*
- **A notification before an API token expires.** *Phase 42.*
- **Dropping `api_tokens.abilities`** once scopes have shipped for a release.
  *Phase 42.*
- **A KMS or Vault backend** for the encryption key. *Phase 40.*
- **Passkey-only sign-in for instance admins.**
- **The README says logos are "uploaded, never fetched"**, but `LogoFetcher`
  fetches a favicon through the guarded client. Correct the copy.
- OIDC is under *Sign-in and accounts*.

### Accessibility and languages

- **A real screen-reader pass.** Structure is covered by `AccessibilityTest`.
  Reading order and control names out of context need a person with a screen
  reader. *Phase 6.*
- **A first translated locale.** The machinery and `i18n:check` are in place,
  and only `en` ships. A real translation is also the only real test of the
  catalogue's keys. *Phase 6.*

### Moved into planned phases

- "Spend removed by cancellations" (*Phases 8, 20*) → Phase 36.
- Page the calendar backwards (*Phase 6*) → Phase 34.
- Encrypt notification channel secrets (*Phase 16*) → Phase 40 (first planned
  as Phase 30).
- Backup history (*Phase 28*) → Phase 38.

## Not planned

These were considered and ruled out. They are not a backlog.

- **Bank / transaction sync** (Plaid, GoCardless, Firefly): out of v1 by the
  spec, and not planned. The Phase 34 ledger does not change this.
- **A single-page client**, CSS-in-JS, a component-framework runtime or an
  offline service worker for the app. Renovo is server-rendered by design.
  *Phases 7, 8.*
- **Anything the browser loads from a third-party host.** The offline rule is
  permanent (`CLAUDE.md`, non-negotiable 8).
- **Per-path HTTP metrics.** The counter grows without limit under a scan;
  status classes answer the question. *Phase 6.*
- **Translating stored notes and audit-log detail.** These are rows and
  machine data, not interface copy. *Phase 6.*
- **A "Keep it" button on trials.** Keeping a trial is what happens when you do
  nothing. *Phase 21.*
- **Discount rules and coupon codes as data** ("20% off", codes). Renovo
  records the price charged and, for an offer, the price it becomes. *Phase 33.*
- **Loan balances, interest rates and amortisation.** A fixed term is a count of
  payments, not a loan calculator. *Phase 35.*
- **Restoring an instance backup from the web.** Replacing every table from a
  browser is one click from disaster; it stays a command. *Phase 38.*
- **Unencrypted instance backups.** They hold password hashes and every invoice.
  *Phase 38.*
- **Upgrading from inside the application.** Renovo tells the operator a release
  exists; pulling images and running migrations stay the operator's job.
  *Phase 37.*
