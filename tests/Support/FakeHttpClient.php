 * behaviour when a provider is unreachable. Neither needs — or should have —
 * a network: a test suite that fails because a third party is having a bad
 * morning is a test suite people learn to ignore.
 *
 * It also records the URLs it was asked for, which is how the tests assert
 * that a provider sent the key and base it was supposed to.
