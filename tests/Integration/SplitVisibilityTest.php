/**
 * The exception to data isolation, and — much more importantly — the exact
 * limits of that exception.
 *
 * A member listed on a shared-cost split may *see* the subscription they are
 * paying part of, even in ISOLATED mode. They may not change it, delete it,
 * re-tag it, or alter the split itself. The scoping layer enforces that by
 * having two predicates rather than one: the widening is composed into reads
 * only, and every write path uses the unwidened predicate.
 *
 * If somebody ever merges the two, these tests are what fails.
