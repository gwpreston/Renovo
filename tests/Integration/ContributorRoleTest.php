/**
 * The Contributor: sees the whole household, changes only their own part of it.
 *
 * The role exists to say one thing that no previous role could say, and it is a
 * sentence with two halves that pull in opposite directions — **read wide, write
 * narrow**. Every other restriction in this application moves both halves at
 * once: ISOLATED mode hides other people's rows *and* refuses writes to them, so
 * for the whole life of the codebase "restricted" meant one thing and one flag
 * answered for it.
 *
 * That is why these tests lean on the read half as hard as the write half. The
 * obvious way to implement this role is to reuse the isolation flag, and it
 * would pass every "a Contributor cannot edit Ada's subscription" test ever
 * written while quietly emptying their subscription list. So the first test here
 * is that they can still *see* everything, and it is the one that fails if the
 * two predicates are ever collapsed back into one.
