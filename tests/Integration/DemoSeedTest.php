/**
 * The demonstration household is the household it claims to be.
 *
 * `DemoModeTest` already covers what demo mode does to writes and what the demo
 * account may see; this covers the shape of what the seed builds, and the one
 * thing about that shape which cannot be seen by looking at the screen it draws:
 * **whose each row is**.
 *
 * That is the whole risk in seeding two members from one command. Every row
 * here is created through a scope, and a fixture passed through the wrong one
 * still appears on the dashboard, in the totals and in the charts — identical
 * in every respect except the member it belongs to, which is the respect the
 * second member exists to demonstrate. A price-history row is the sharpest case
 * of it, because the member who made the change is passed to the repository
 * *beside* the scope rather than taken from it, so the two can disagree without
 * anything failing.
 *
 * The role itself is not re-proved here — `ContributorRoleTest` does that. What
 * is proved is that the demo has a Contributor at all, that they own their own
 * things, and that their budgets are theirs.
