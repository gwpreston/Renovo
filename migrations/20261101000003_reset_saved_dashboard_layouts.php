/**
 * Everybody starts from the new dashboard's defaults, once.
 *
 * Phase 21 replaces the dashboard's card set wholesale. A saved layout from
 * before it orders cards that mostly no longer exist, so keeping it would put
 * the new cards after the positions of retired ones — an arrangement nobody
 * chose. Clearing the rows returns every account to the default layout, which
 * is what an account that never rearranged anything already has; anybody can
 * arrange the new cards again from their profile. The release notes say so.
 *
 * `down()` does nothing, deliberately: a deletion cannot be undone, and the
 * rows it removed describe a dashboard the rolled-back code would no longer
 * draw the same way either. Rolling back past this migration leaves every
 * account on the default layout, which is a working state.
