/**
 * Whose spending a budget measures.
 *
 * Until now a budget measured its owner's share and nothing else, so the owner
 * and the subject were one column. They separate here: the owner is whoever set
 * the budget, the subject is the member it measures, and null means the whole
 * household.
 *
 * Every existing budget is backfilled to measure its owner, which is exactly
 * what it measured before — no projection changes on upgrade. `ON DELETE
 * CASCADE` matches how a departing member's own budgets already go.
 *
 * On MySQL this is not transactional. Should it stop halfway, the manual
 * rollback is: drop the foreign key `fk_budgets_subject_user`, then the index
 * `ix_budgets_subject_user`, then the column.
