/**
 * The bundled entry point.
 *
 * This is deliberately small. The application's own behaviour — keyboard
 * shortcuts, the quick-add dialog, passkey registration — lives in
 * `public/assets/app.js` and `public/assets/webauthn.js`, which are
 * hand-written, served directly and untouched by this build. htmx is vendored
 * the same way. None of them needed bundling and so none of them were moved.
 *
 * What this file provides is what does: a chart library too large to load on
 * every page, exposed on `window.Renovo` with a helper for building an icon
 * from the sprite. (Icons used to be filled in here after the page painted;
 * since Phase 18 the server renders them, so the navigation has its pictures
 * with the script blocked.) Phase 10 added the first page that draws a chart:
 * the dashboard's twelve-month spend, from a payload the server rendered beside the canvas.
 * Phase 12 added the second kind and the first page carrying two — the
 * analytics screen's spending trajectory beside its category donut — which is
 * why the drawing below is a list rather than a call.
 *
 * Usage from a page's own script:
 *
 *     await window.Renovo.chart(canvas, { type: 'line', data: … });
 *     element.append(window.Renovo.icon('calendar'));
